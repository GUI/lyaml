lyaml NEWS - User visible changes

* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

** New Features:

  - New lyaml.emitter API returns an object with an emit method for
    adding events using yaml_*_event_initialize() calls.

  - New lyaml.parser API returns a Lua iterator that fetches the next
    event using yaml_parser_parse().

  - New lyaml.scanner API returns a Lua iterator that fetches the next
    token using yaml_parser_scan().

  - Beginnings of Specl specs, starting with a reasonably comprehensive
    specifications for the new APIs above.

** Bug Fixes:

  - The Lua implementation of yaml.load () handles multi-document
    streams, but returns a table of documents unlike earlier releases
    which returned just the first document.

** Incompatible Changes:

  - C implementation of lyaml.dump has moved to Lua implementation as
    yaml.dump.

  - C implementation of lyaml.load has moved to Lua implementation as
    yaml.load.

  - If you only care about the first document in a stream, you can
    support both new (multi-doc) and old (first doc only) APIs of lyaml
    as follows:

      local ok, yaml = pcall (require, "yaml")
      if not ok then
        yaml = require "lyaml"
        local v3load = yaml.load
        yaml.load = function (...) return {v3load (...)}
      end

    ...and then access the first document with `yaml.load "foo")[1]` or
    similar.


* Noteworthy changes in release 3 (2013-04-27) [beta]

** This release is functionally identical to the last.

** New Features:

  - lyaml builds are now made against Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2 and luajit 2.0.0
    automatically, with every commit.

  - move to a cleaner, automated release system.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2 (2013-03-18) [beta]

** This release is functionally identical to the last.

** Use correct MIT license attribution, relicensing build files to match
   Androw Danforth's MIT licensed lyaml.c too.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1 (2013-03-17) [beta]

** New Features:

  - A binding for libYAML, by Andrew Danforth:  Updated for Lua 5.1 and
    5.2, and packaged as a luarock.

  - I spun this out of Specl (http://github.com/gvvaughan/specl) so that
    other projects may use it, and to simplify the Specl build.

** Known Issuse:

  - There's not really any documentation, sorry.  Contributions welcome!
